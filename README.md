# phototag
Phototag is an open source software for geotagging pictures using GoogleMaps. Geotags are saved in EXIF format, if a picture is already tagged, the corresponding location will be shown on the map.
Pictures can be tagged or retagged by dragging  and dropping it at a desired location on the map.
The software requires the ExifTool to read/write exif tags (https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool). The executable (e.g. exiftool.exe on Windows) should be available in the same directory as the Phototag executable.

# Compiling
The software is based on Qt libraries. So you need to configure your Qt project environment and then build this project using Qt tools of your choice (e.g. Qt Creator). For more information on Qt visit https://www.qt.io
